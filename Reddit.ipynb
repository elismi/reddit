How is it legal to actually put an ad on a news site and spread misinformation like Melvin is currently doing? They are trying to panic retail investors into selling. Only problem is CNBC now only appeals to big money and conservative boomers. This is bigger than GME, hedge funds causing massive shorts for profits should be illegal. Weâ€™re only playing under the same rules they are. They are the degens for doing this for years, not regular Joe and Mary Jane who invest in stocks.

Their IOT and space within space (literal aerospace)  will be IMO what will cause the \"hype\" this year (maybe next year 2022) and or \"speculative growth\" that will propel them to easily triple digits.\n",

      "\n",
      "I did a personal analysis to calculate the price of BB.  Comparing various companies in similar industries market cap, sales, price, and speculative growth (this is the most variable of course) of over a dozen companies today. It shows that today (that this year, however could be going into 2022)  BB should be at least at $80 a share. This number IMO is conservative.\n",

      "EDIT: The last few weeks: Given this momentum and volume trading, WSB (and the world getting in) may push for this noise in marketing and pushing this stock to 80 easy by years end. This stock is very \"meme\"able and it has a lot of sentiment (from boomers and millennials alike) and future speculation that the could propel it. Any easy youtube video will describe \"QNX\", meme's could be easily assigned to \"john chen\" its CEO (he too btw has stock bonus incentives like a musk) could easily by WSB's new \"sue bae\", or dadda chen or something sticky. Once more media starts treating BB more seriously with the help of WSB, it will stay higher in price (never again trading at below 10 ...or even 5 as a penny stock lol), and these next few weeks may yield that. lets see..\n",
